### Projects
These projects were created using [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) and [Unity.](https://unity3d.com/) Read my own description of [Vuforia here.](https://bootupcorner.blogspot.com/2016/04/what-is-vuforia.html) The idea behind this project is using a background image and using vuforia to map that space. Then using Unity, you place a 3d character or object in the space mapped by vuforia. Then using a phone, you can see this character.
  
The projects are are very similar. The main difference between them is using different images for the mapping with Vuforia. And the later projects have different 3d objects that display. 

#### 1. Unity_AR - 
- This projects the solor system with orbiting planets.

#### 2. Unity_AR2 - 
- This shows a samuri guy doing a slashing motion.

#### 3. Unity_AR3 - 
- This one is more of a sandbox. It has a plane that takes off. And 2 cars that move.
